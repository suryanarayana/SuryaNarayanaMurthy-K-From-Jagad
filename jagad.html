            [content] =&gt; Do you really need a reason? The City of Lights means the Eiffel Tower, the Pompidou Center, the Louvre, the Musée d’Orsay, the Arc de Triomphe, Versaille, Montmartre, the Pantheon and Notre Dame. Then there’s the food, the street life, the history . . . Alas, you’re not the only person arriving in Paris – it pays to do some planning. In Paris, the quality of your experience can depend on the kind of ticket you have. Avoiding the crowds is good. Privileged access is good. Expert guides can reveal more than your guidebook could ever tell you. Sometimes, you discover that a nighttime or early-morning visit is quieter and more atmospheric. If you’re going to ‘do’ Paris, do it right. At the same time, remember there’s a whole other city waiting to be explored. In the laid-back districts of Belleville and Ménilmontant, you can tour the distinctive street art and learn more about such Parisian legends as Seth, Clet, Mesnager or Invader. A historical walk could introduce you to a bloodier history of massacres, executions, plague, torture and imprisonment. At the Fragonard Perfume Museum, you can create your own cologne. War enthusiasts, meanwhile, may be tempted to visit the nearby beaches of Normandy and see the D-Day battlefields first hand. The Dôme des Invalides allows the martial-minded to feast on the activities of Napoleon Bonaparte and explore one of the world’s greatest collections of antique arms and armor.

            [more] =&gt; Not far off is the Roman Forum, what remains of the financial, religious and political center of ancient Rome, the heart of the urban complex of the Imperial Forums, which extended between the Capitoline Hill and the Quirinal. A city with beautiful gardens and ancient aristocratic villas, like the Villa Borghese, Rome is also famous for its monumental fountains, real architectural gems. The most famous is the Trevi Fountain, in rococo style, that is known for being the setting of the most famous scene of 'La dolce vita', classic italian movie by Federico Fellini.

Don't miss the Baroque Fountain of the Four Rivers, one of the greatest masterpieces of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, located in the heart of Piazza Navona, elegant meeting point in the evening. Piazza di Spagna is also very crowded and popular, with its Spanish Steps. Capital with beautiful churches, Rome includes the Vatican City, the cradle of Catholic Christianity. Its masterpiece is the imposing St. Peter's Basilica, whose dome, designed by Michelangelo, overlooks the whole of Rome. Michelangelo also signed the famous frescoes of the Sistine Chapel, the conclave for the Pope's election. The heart of nightlife in this pleasure-seeking city is Trastevere, a former working-class district on the west bank of the Tiber River, a beautiful and lively maze of narrow streets and trendy bars.

            [code] =&gt; milan
            [content] =&gt; City of culture. City of fashion. City of heavenly ice creams and yellow rice. If you listen to some people, Milan is a place where you’ll be ostracized for wearing a tracksuit in public. In truth, this is a great northern Italian city with as many faces as a fashionista. Leonardo da Vinci lived here for a while. You can visit the very vineyard where he relaxed while painting the Last Supper. Tickets can be hard to obtain for this most famous of meals, so it’s best to plan in advance. Afterwards, visit the Leonardo3 Museum, where you can learn more about the master’s life and see models of his creations. Milan rewards walking. From the Piazza Duomo, you can tour the colossal cathedral, the monumental Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, majestic La Scala and the old district of La Brera. Sforzesco Castle is a little further if you’d like to see the grandeur of Milan’s ruling dukes, while the city’s art galleries are a real treat for their permanent and ever-changing temporary exhibitions. If you need more labels in your life, take off the tracksuit and stroll the exclusive Via Monte Napoleone. Then, when you tire of past glories, go to the brand new Piazza Gae Aulenti to see the Unicredit Tower designed by architect César Pell. Beyond the city center, Milan’s districts offer different perspectives. Navigli is a cool network of canals whose bars and restaurants cast dancing reflections off the water at night. The previously blue-collar neighborhood of Isola has been reborn as a leafy oasis of notable street art, cafes, bars, boutiques, galleries and clubs – basically, hipster central. Citta Studi around Piazza Leonardo is where the students congregate, and therefore where you’ll find some good craft beers. If Milan’s charms fade (unlikely), you’re in the middle of a region that offers you easy excursions to beautiful Lake Como, Verona, the wine country of Pavia and even Venice. The dolce vita begins here...
            [meta_description] =&gt; Discover Milan and book tickets to the best tours, museums, and attractions. Admire the Duomo of Milan, visit Leonardo's Last Supper or go on a city walking tour.

Among the Gothic Quarter and El Born, you’ll taste the finest wines and tapas. At Poble Espanyol, you can enjoy traditional crafts and culture amid centuries of architectural diversity (the area features replicas of great buildings from across Spain). The views from Montjuïc are rightly famous, and you should leave a little time for the collections of the Fran Daurel Museum, which include Picasso, Dalí, Miró, Tàpies and Barceló. When the city gets too hot or crowded, there are some fascinating excursions. Montserrat monastery is a spectacular eyrie at 4,051 feet with amazing views and a rich Catholic heritage. In the Guara Mountains, you’ll find the thousand-year-old village of Alquézar with its artisans and gastronomic specialties. Sitges, meanwhile, is a combination of beach life and Modernist styling – a great place for shopping and traditional sweets.

Located on the Garonne River in southwestern France, Bordeaux is known for being the country's most prominent wine region and is the center of wine-growing and producing. The city was introduced to wine during the mid -first century when Bordeaux was under rule of the Romans. From the 12th to the 15th century, Bordeaux flourished following the marriage of Duchess Eleonore of Aquittance to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, who later became King Henry II of England. After being granted a tax-free trade status with England, many locals benefitted from this and were able to increase their profits trading wine.Bordeaux is also known for its high-spirited university-student population that makes it one of the most vibrant and dynamic cities of France. Called "La perle d'Aquitaine" (The Pearl of Aquitaine) and "La Belle Endormie" (Sleeping Beauty), Bordeaux barely sleeps offering a smooth lifestyle and an awesome setting. Many festivals are held throughout the year including the Bordeaux river festival and Vinexpo, the world's main wine festival.Half of the city is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site, boulevards became pedestrian-friendly and neoclassical architecture has been restored. Add some world-class architectural buildings, a water-mirror, an exceptional dining scene, an escapade in vineyards and you've almost reached paradise. Take a walking tour through the back streets of the city to learn about the rich history, or enjoy a glass of some of the finest wine in the world!

A tour of the city can only start from the historic center with its narrow streets, a Unesco World Heritage Site since 1992. At its heart is the Old Town Square, surrounded by magnificent buildings, cafes, shops and galleries. Dominating the square are the Gothic spires of the Church of Our Lady before Tyn.

This mighty monumental complex, consisting of church and residential buildings, fortifications and offices, was originally the residence of princes and kings of Bohemia; since 1918 it has been the seat of the President of the Republic. The area of the castle is dominated by the Gothic St. Vitus Cathedral, the largest and most magnificent church in Prague.Take a stroll in Golden Lane with its picturesque houses, home to alchemists before and goldsmiths later, but also to Franz Kafka, the most illustrious son of Prague and famous writer. Inevitable stop is to admire the romantic Charles Bridge, a stone bridge in the Gothic style that connects the Old Town to the Lesser Quarter, commissioned by Charles IV in 1357 and designed by the architect Petr Parler. On the other hand, the symbol of modern Prague is the sinuous Dancing House, designed in the nineties by the architect Frank O. Gehry and inspired by the famous pair of dancers Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire.

The same past that has been converted into a present full of cultural and intellectual depth.

Not far from the Lodge Armory, you get to the Royal Armory, one of the most important in Europe because of its rich and varied collection of weapons and armors. In the north-east part of the center, La Mole stands with grandeur. The emblem of Turin houses today the National Museum of Cinema.

Beating heart of culture and life for Icelanders, as well as focal point for tourists, the city has a small but extremely lively centre. Reykjavík's, however, stretches out to its suburbs, with the summer 24-hours light seeping through the residential neighbourhoods. During winter, on the other hand, wind, darkness and snow are the protagonists.Just like day and night, Iceland's capital is filled with contrasts: old versus new, colors versus snow white purity, fervour of a modern city-life versus silence of a frozen landscape. Reykjavík is all this and much more, part of which is yet to be discovered as the Sun Voyager, the dreamboat sculpture weighing anchor toward freedom and future, simbolically communicates.

            [content] =&gt; “So many things I don’t need!” remarked Socrates as he strolled around the agora (marketplace) of ancient Athens. You may feel the same browsing the flea markets of Plaka and the tourist alleys of Athens’ varied neighborhoods, but you’ll be walking in the footsteps of Saint Paul, Alexander the Great, Augustus Caesar, Plato, Aristotle . . . Naturally, the Acropolis and its immortal buildings will draw your attention. There’s nothing quite like ascending through the monumental gate and facing the Parthenon’s august facade, the Temple of Athena Nike unassuming just to your side. Then there’s the Ancient Agora where Socrates and Diogenes argued, Plato’s Academy, the Temple of Olympian Zeus and more famous ruins that you can possibly visit. It’s a good idea to join a walking tour. Syntagma, Anafiotika, Monastiraki and Psirri are some of the better-known districts, and you may want to spend some time among the cafes and shops of Ermou Street in the retail center. Pireaus is a little further out, but has more of a village vibe around the old port of Athens. Be sure to pause, order a Greek coffee or iced Frappe and watch the people go by – it’s a national pastime! With such good transport connections, Athens is also good for excursions to the islands and the mainland. The monastic towers of Meteora and the stupendous vistas of Delphi are within reach, while out to sea you’ll discover the sleepy islands of Hydra, Poros and Aegina. It doesn’t matter what time you return – Athens is one of those cities that has a rush hour at 2.00am!

Above the city, Christ the Redeemer rides the clouds on Corcovado Hill, arms outstretched like a holy surfer. The sun is hot. The chilled coconut water is refreshing. Welcome to Brazil!Beyond the beaches, Rio is a city of many attractions. The Sambadome, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Selaron Steps, the National Museum and the historical buildings of Cinelandia Square are all must-sees. Of course, you’ll also take the cable car up Corcovado (the same cable car in which James Bond fought Jaws in Moonraker) and ascend Sugar Loaf Mountain for the views. Up in the hills, the quaint Santa Teresa district and the vibrant favelas present alternative perspectives on Rio life.When the weather gets too hot, flee the traffic and noise to nearby Petropolis – a curious German settlement where the architecture is quite bizarre. For the best views of the city from a distance, we recommend a trip to Gavea Rock high in the mountains above the coast. From here, Sugar Loaf is just a cupcake and the city is a toy.

            [content] =&gt; If you look for a city with pictures of modernity in Vietnam, Saigon should be the best. Officially re-named as Ho Chi Minh City, Saigon as known by most of foreign tourists is a young but thriving metropolis, with an obvious Western flavor and influence offering quite a different experience than Hanoi or any other town.This is the biggest commercial hub of the country, the rendezvous of not just business people but business movers. Beside its hectic life, Saigon remains and preserves traces of brilliant history in the Notre Dame Cathedral, Reunification Palace, Grand Hall, Museums, temples, Cu Chi Tunnel system and so forth.It obviously promises sufficient fascinating things to discover, whilst it remains as a center for mixed cultures and worth several days to hang around. Saigon is doing its best to regain its famous name from early 20th century: "The Pearl of the Far Orient".
